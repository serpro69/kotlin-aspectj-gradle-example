An example project showing load-time weaving of Kotlin classes with AspectJ and Gradle.

### Motivation
This project is a followup for [kotlin-aspectj-maven-example](https://github.com/serpro69/kotlin-aspectj-maven-example)
to reach the same objective but using Gradle instead of maven.

### Running tests
This project uses gradle wrapper hence there's no need to have a local gradle installation.

After the project is cloned and initialized execute: `$ ./gradlew clean test` to run tests.
